                    Hey there! I'm Katarzyna, and I've got a story to share. A decade ago I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's. But you know what they say, when life hands you lemons, make lemonade! In my case, I turned to the power of food to reclaim my health.

I've always believed that food is more than just fuel; it's medicine. Armed with a passion for natural compounds and a background as a chef, I embarked on a mission to fix myself through the magic of nutrition.

Before the diagnosis, I battled brain fog, depression and anxiety. But discovering the incredible impact of mindful eating on my well-being was a game-changer.

Now, I'm not just a chef; I'm your health companion on a mission. With a keen interest in nutrition, I'm here to share the wisdom I've gathered along my journey. From combating Hashimoto's symptoms to navigating the world of holistic health, let's walk this path together.

Join me at Thrive Hub, where we believe that food can be the ultimate remedy and that good health is a journey, not a destination. Together, let's savor the flavors of well-being and make every bite count!
